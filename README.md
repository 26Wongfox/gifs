by [Lena Groeger](https://twitter.com/lenagroeger)


This tutorial will teach you how to:

1. Make a simple [two-photo gif](https://github.com/lenagroeger/gifs#animated-gif-simple-2-photo-animation) in Photoshop.
2. Make a [multiple-photo or series gif](https://github.com/lenagroeger/gifs#animated-gif-multiple-photo-animation) in Photoshop.
3. Make a [video or screensharing gif](https://github.com/lenagroeger/gifs#animated-gif-video-animation) using Photoshop & Quicktime.


##Animated Gif: Simple 2-Photo Animation ##
Do you have an interactive graphic you'd like to promote on the front page? Animated Gifs are a great way to draw attention to interactive work.

1. We're going to use these two delightful before-after photos, which you can download here: [Image 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lenagroeger/photoshop/master/zipped/taxidermy1.jpeg) and [Image 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lenagroeger/photoshop/master/zipped/taxidermy2.jpeg)

<br>[Full back story](http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/real-estate/brokers-digital-trickery-sell-drab-apartments-article-1.1885998), and [a related something you should read on the trip home from IRE](http://www.susanorlean.com/articles/lifelike.html).

2. Open up Photoshop, and go to Window > Timeline.

3. You should now see a bottom bar with a tab called Timeline.

4. Open up both photos in Photoshop and copy and paste them into the same file (Or just drag and drop them in). You should end up with each photo on its own layer.

5. Click on "Create Frame Animation."
![](https://github.com/lenagroeger/photoshop/blob/master/screengrabs/photogif4.jpg)



6. You should see a little box with a photo, we'll refer to that as a single "frame."<br>
![](https://github.com/lenagroeger/photoshop/blob/master/screengrabs/photogif3b.jpg)

7. Go ahead and set the duration for .5 seconds.<br>
![](https://github.com/lenagroeger/photoshop/blob/master/screengrabs/photogif6.jpg)

8. And then set the looping to FOREVER (I mean, go big or go home).<br>
![](https://github.com/lenagroeger/photoshop/blob/master/screengrabs/photogif7.jpg)

9. Now we need to make a second frame with the other photo. You can do this two ways. We'll do the manual way first. Click on the new page button.<br>
![](https://github.com/lenagroeger/photoshop/blob/master/screengrabs/photogif3c.jpg)


10. You should see a new frame appear.<br>
![](https://github.com/lenagroeger/photoshop/blob/master/screengrabs/photogif7b.jpg)

11. Now we have a new frame, but they both look the same! So with the second frame selected, go over to your layers and click on the eye icon to toggle one layer off and reveal the second photo.<br>
![](https://github.com/lenagroeger/photoshop/blob/master/screengrabs/photogif7c.jpg)<br>

12. The animation frames reflect the current state of your layers, so we've just set the second frame to show the second photo. If you look closely you should see that the frame indeed looks different (it's full of taxidermy).<br>
![](https://github.com/lenagroeger/photoshop/blob/master/screengrabs/photogif7d.jpg)

13. If you have more than 2 or 3 layers and need to make them all frames, a shortcut is to go to the Timeline dropdown and select "Make Frames from Layers"

14. Go to File > Save for Web.
![](https://github.com/lenagroeger/photoshop/blob/master/screengrabs/photogif8.jpg)

15. Save it as a gif!
![](https://github.com/lenagroeger/photoshop/blob/master/screengrabs/photogif9.jpg)

16. Now, open up that gif in a browser. You should see a spectacular transformation of dead animals.

17. Now, contemplate all the much more useful combinations of photos you can now make into gifs.



##Animated Gif: Multiple Photo Animation ##

1. Let's say you want to do more than animate between 2 photos, you want to show a progression of many photos, like [this example from the Wall Street Journal.](http://graphics.wsj.com/ukraine-rebel-maps/)
2. Let's try it! [Download this folder](https://github.com/lenagroeger/photoshop/blob/master/zipped/Ukraine.zip?raw=true) and open one of the images from the Ukraine folder in Photoshop.
3. Drag and drop your other images onto the stage. This will bring them into your file as separate layers.<br>
  ![](https://github.com/lenagroeger/photoshop/blob/master/screengrabs/GifLayers.png)<br>

4. Like we did before, select **Window > Timeline** from the toolbar to open up a new panel in Photoshop.
5. From the Timeline panel, click on "Create Frame Animation".
7. From the dropdown in the upper right of the Timeline window, select "Make Frames from Layers"

8. Make sure your frames are in the correct sequence, then set the duration for which you'd like each to display.<br>
  ![](https://github.com/lenagroeger/photoshop/blob/master/screengrabs/SetFrameDurations.png)

9. Select **File > Save for Web**
10. Select Gif as your save format. At the bottom of the window, you'll also be able to set the number of times you'd like the animation to loop. For a homepage promo, it might not be appropriate to loop infinitely, but we'll pick "Forever" for now.

11. Save and you're done. Woot!



##Animated Gif: Video Animation ##


1. Sometimes you want to convert a short segment of a video to a gif, whether that's a YouTube clip or a screen recording. You can do this easily with QuickTime + Photoshop. Let's try it out on  [this Guardian interactive on measles](http://www.theguardian.com/society/ng-interactive/2015/feb/05/-sp-watch-how-measles-outbreak-spreads-when-kids-get-vaccinated).</a>

2. Open up QuickTime, and select "New Screen Recording."
![](https://github.com/lenagroeger/photoshop/blob/master/screengrabs/screengif1.jpg)

3. A little popup box will appear, click on the Red Record button to start recording.
![](https://github.com/lenagroeger/photoshop/blob/master/screengrabs/screengif2.jpg)

4. But that doesn't actually start the recording, you have to select a viewport for your recording. Go ahead and do that. Then click "Start Recording."
![](https://github.com/lenagroeger/photoshop/blob/master/screengrabs/screengif3.jpg)

5. After some seconds, hit the very difficult to find "Stop" button at the top of your screen.<br>
![](https://github.com/lenagroeger/photoshop/blob/master/screengrabs/screengif4.jpg)

6. Now save that movie recording to your Desktop.<br>
![](https://github.com/lenagroeger/photoshop/blob/master/screengrabs/screengif3b.jpg)

7. Open up Photoshop, select Import > Video Frames to Layers.
![](https://github.com/lenagroeger/photoshop/blob/master/screengrabs/screengif5.jpg)

8. You'll get a little slider where you can select precisely the seconds of video you want for your gif (smaller is better for loading times).
![](https://github.com/lenagroeger/photoshop/blob/master/screengrabs/screengif6.jpg)

9. You should end up with this:<br>
![](https://github.com/lenagroeger/photoshop/blob/master/screengrabs/screengif7.jpg)

10. See all those layers? Those are all the frames of your little gif!<br>
![](https://github.com/lenagroeger/photoshop/blob/master/screengrabs/screengif8.jpg)

11. Ok, let's save this thing. Go to File > Save for Web<br>
![](https://github.com/lenagroeger/photoshop/blob/master/screengrabs/screengif9.jpg)

12. Make sure you have "Gif" as the format type, and that Looping Options are set to Forever. Save it!<br>
![](https://github.com/lenagroeger/photoshop/blob/master/screengrabs/screengif10.jpg)

13. Now, open up that gif in a browser. Happy giffing!<br>
